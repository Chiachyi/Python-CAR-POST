Introduction
------------

**GAFT** is a general Python Framework for genetic algorithm computation. It provides built-in genetic operators for target optimization and plugin interfaces for users to define your own genetic operators and on-the-fly analysis for algorithm testing.

**GAFT** is now accelerated using MPI parallelization interfaces. You can run it on your cluster in parallel with MPI environment.
